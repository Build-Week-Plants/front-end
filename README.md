# Front End

Lambda School - Unit 2 & 3 (React)

## Motivation

The motivation for this project was to create an app that helps remind you when to water your plants. The front end of this project focused on building an app that allows a user to log in, add plants to their account, and set notifications to remind them when to water their plants.

## Tech/Framework Used:

- React
- Axios
- Context API
- Styled Components

## Installation/How To Use

Run npm install to install required dependencies. Run npm start to boot the project on localhost.

Create an account and log in with your credentials. Users easily can view, add, edit, and delete plants from their profile.

## Credit

This project was able to come together in large part due to our small but motivated team. We had a blast working on this app and are looking forward to working on more projects together in the future on our journey to become professional web developers.
